Blobserver
==========

About
-----
Blobserver is an OSC-based server aimed at detecting entities (objects / people / light / ...), in any compatible image flow. Its structure is so that it should be relatively easy to add new actuators as well as new image sources. As of yet, configuration and communication with Blobserver is done entirely through OSC messaging. Some kind of configuration file will be added soon to simplify the setup and usability, especially for permanent installations.
Blobserver is built around the concept of flow. A flow is the association of a actuator and as many sources as needed for it to work correctly. At each frame, all the flows are evaluated, and the various objects detected are sent through OSC to the corresponding clients.

Installation
------------
Here is how to build and install it on Debian GNU/Linux or Ubuntu Precise::

  sudo apt-get install help2man gettext automake bison build-essential flex libtool 
  sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev liblo0-dev
  sudo apt-get install liblcms2-dev libxml2-dev libtbb-dev
  sudo apt-get install libshmdata-0.8

We need the latest version of OpenCV, which is not yet packaged for Ubuntu. So:
  cd ..
  git clone git://code.opencv.org/opencv.git
  cd opencv
  git checkout 2.4.6
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_TBB=ON ..
  make
  sudo make install

Then we can compile blobserver:
  cd ../../blobserver
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

Optional installation
---------------------
Some parts of blobserver are not mandatory, and you need some additional packages to build them. The following commands must be entered before the compiling of blobserver

--> PCL support (for point cloud support):
  cd ..
  git clone https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl pcl	
  cd pcl
  git checkout pcl-1.7.0
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make && sudo make install
  cd ../blobserver/

--> LibMapper support (for automatic OSC discovery):
  cd ..
  git clone git@github.com:libmapper/libmapper.git
  cd libmapper
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make && sudo make install
  cd ../blobserver/

--> Aravis support (for GiGe cameras):
  cd ..
  git clone git://git.gnome.org/aravis
  cd aravis
  ./autogen.sh
  make && sudo make install
  cd ../blobserver/

--> GLSL support (for Actuator_GLSL)
  cd ..
  git clone git@github.com:glfw/glfw.git
  cd glfw
  git checkout 3.0.3
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
  make && sudo make install
  cd ../../blobserver/

  Also, GLM is needed:
  sudo apt-get install libglm-dev
